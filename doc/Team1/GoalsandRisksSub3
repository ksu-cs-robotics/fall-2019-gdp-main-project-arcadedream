Team Leader: Sierra Reed
Primary Duty: Game Design
Secondary Duty: Art

Main Game Goals:
New Highscore Announcement UI
Complete and ensure all UI is working (Title screen, settings options, character creation, login/setup, etc)

Sub-Game Goals:
Make artwork for game 3, platformer. 
This will be broken down into tickets once we have the design document.

Main Game Risks:
UI buttons not working properly
highscores not working properly
shop system not working properly
Playing an arcade game in multiplayer 

Sub-Game Risks:
Sprites not working properly
Sprite movement missing (don’t have proper setup)
More risks once design document is finished. 



Concerns raised in the extreme pong testing questions:
Power ups only work on server side 
Rotating only server side
Score only server side
Phantom balls don’t despawn - if they don’t hit a goal within 15 seconds they will despawn.
Ball movement buggy - fix how the ball changes direction
Make sure UI works with different resolutions
Larger paddles for paddle grow power up
Power ups need to work with both 2 player and 4 player
Need to get the number of players from the networking script and spawn the correct amount of players based on that.
