Risks of the iteration

9/25/19

The risks of this iteration include:

The subgame not following the design document as intended (better communication would of been needed).

UI does not accurately attribute to the game (score is not kept right, highscores dont appear proper).

Playing game has issues (when going from hub, to game, back to hub.)

Wrong UI prompts when needed (2player prompts arent seen or seen when not supposed to be).
