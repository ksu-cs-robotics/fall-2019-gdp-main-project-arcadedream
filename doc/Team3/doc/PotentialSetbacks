Team 3: DIO
Potential setbacks for itteration 1

1.) Missing textures (have to make sure ounce textures are set to matirials they are not moved)
2.) Models not ligning up right (example the laset comes out of the nose an not the gun)
3.) Music playing out of sync (not looping correctly)
4.) Images be incompatible with engine (chances of this are very low)
