Option 1
 - Main arcade game is dedicated host and all players connect to that. 
 - When players enter a cabinet they got to a p2p like hosted game. 
Option 2
 - Everything is p2p and we host a database with coin numbers. 

We are probably going to go p2p first. Make sure we get SOMETHING working and have good set of
tickets to work on. We created 4 new tickets as stated above.
