When implementing into main scene:
-Bake a navmesh into scene (with a bathroom safe area)
-add navmesh agent to owner (speed can be tweaked)
-create an empty gameobject for the owner to return to when he stole tickets
-tag objects appropriately:
	player: ArcadePlayer
	cabinets: GameCabinet
-add another box collider to players and cabinets that extend further

In player script:
-Add a private canBeStolen variable
-When the player enters a collider on a gamecabinet, set to false
-When the player exist a collider on a a gamecabinet, set to true
-Add a getter for the canBeStolen variable
