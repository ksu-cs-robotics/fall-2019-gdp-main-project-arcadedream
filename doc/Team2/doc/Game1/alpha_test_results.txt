Q11: Any other comments/concerns?
-I feel like to make it so there is more to do even though it is only one level we could loop the first level around.

-Maybe make the players range of motion larger. It feels very cramped

-Suggestion for PU's, maybe have them slow down once the asteroid is shot so that they are easier to see/read/grab. For something like rapid fire, maybe make it a limited time thing? Because it's so powerful. Either that, or decrease firing speed. Change asteroids to be circles instead of squares (either that or change the model). Crab boss should spawn farther down so he doesn't move up off the screen.

-Enemies seem to be stationary and not act like they are going toward player, the player goes toward them (weird game feel compared to other games in the genre). No external environments were included (like colony wreckage for scene building), and the boss was not stationed as it was in the design document (it is supposed to be stationary and fire straight projectiles as the player fights it, not homing lasers).

-Also, keys were not mapped to what they were supposed to (sdf and arrow keys not used).
