Camera Controller Doc - Josh Dotson

CameraController.cs allows the camera to follow a specified gameObject from a predefined viewpoint. When the referenced gameObject moves
to a new position, the parent Camera object will smoothly interpolate to this new viewing position. 

SMOOTHING allows one to adjust how much
lag there is between the camera starting to move when the player moves, as well as, stopping when the player stops moving. The higher the,
the smoother the transition between points will be.

Start() Initializes the parent camera with the particular offset present between the camera and player at start. It also defines an
interacting offset to allow the camera to transition to a different closer offset when the player is making an interaction with an
interactable object.

LateUpdate() is called after all other update functions are called, and thus saves resources for more important functions in other scripts.
Here, we have the slow interpolation between the players position + offset, and the current location of the camera. If the player is interacting,
the interacting offset will be active causing the camera to zoom into an over the shoulder view of the object from the players perspective
