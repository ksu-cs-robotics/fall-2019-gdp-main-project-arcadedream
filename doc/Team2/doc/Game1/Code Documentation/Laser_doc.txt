Laser - Lew

Variables: object to keep track of who shot the laser, the laser's speed, and a variable to keep track of
whether it is on screen or not.

Start(): sets the shooter to the parent of the current instance of the laser.

Update(): Moves the laser across the screen at the specified speed.

OnBecameVisible(): Sets the visible variable to true

OnBecameInvisible(): Once the objects goes offscreen, it will be destroyed and visible variable will
be set back to false.  This is to prevent unnecessary memory usage.

OnTriggerEnter(): If the laser collides with the player, do nothing. Prevents the player from being
destroyed by their own laser. If the laser collides with an enemy, get the health component of the enemy,
and call the takeDamage function. The shooter of the laser is then awarded with points and that is added
to their total score.
