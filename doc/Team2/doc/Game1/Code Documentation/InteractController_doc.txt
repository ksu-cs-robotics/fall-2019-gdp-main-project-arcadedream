Interact Controller Doc - Josh Dotson

The InteractController provides and easy to use backend framework to players to interact with any interactable object in the world no matter
what that object may be. It will accept player interactions, check them for blacklisting, and if passed, active a the referenced UI element
in UIGameObject.

InteractText - Stores predefined text that is the text that will appear on the players UI display when he/she is near the interactable
object, and it is selected as there current interactable object in PlayerController.

blacklist_m - Stores a list of blacklisted players for this object to see if the player is allowed to interact. This is purely conceptual
at this point, and is not implemented to any real extent at the time of this writing (Version 1).

OnInteract - An event based interact handler that defaults to enabling the referenced UIGameObject. This supports dynamically changing interact
behavior at runtime allowing for a greater degree of flexability.

The default constuctor gives OnInteract is default behaviour, and the Action constuctor takes a delegate/lambda corresponing to a new set
of interaction behaviors.

Interact simply checks to blacklist first, and then invokes OnInteract. If the user is denied, it will throw the User Denied exception.
