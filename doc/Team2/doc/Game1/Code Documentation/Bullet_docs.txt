Bullet - Josh, Jared and Lew 

Implements a basic controller for bullet funcitonality. Speed of bullets is not determined by the script, only what happens on impact, and 
whether or not the bullet should be destroyed.

Start() - Takes a reference to the entity who shot this bullet and stores it in Shooter. That way if this bullet kills someone, we will
be able to determine who should get the credit for it.

OnTriggerEnter() - Defines a series of actions that need to be performed when the bullet collides with something based on the collider's tag
