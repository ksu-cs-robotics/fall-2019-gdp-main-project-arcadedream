Enemy - Jared Anderson, Josh Dotson

Implements and/or defines the basic enemy mechanics such as behaviors, weapons, projectile prefabs and speed, and movement
speed.

SPEED - Defines movement speed of the enemy in m/speed
BULLETSPEED - Defines bullet speed in m/speed

PROJECTILE - takes by reference the prefab of the projectile this enemy shoots
primaryWeapon_m - stores predefined weapon configuration for this enemy from EnemyWeapons
weaponTimer_m - keeps track of the amount of time since the last shot to make sure a weapon is firing within the FireRate
parameters set within primaryWeapon_m.

behavior_m = Stores a predefined behaviour configuration that this enemy will follow to control its movement, and attacking
behaviourIterator_m = gets an iterator for behavior_m allowing to the ease of cycling through the behavior loop one interval
at a time.

BEHAVIOURINTERVAL - The amount of time allowed before switching to the next stage of the behavior_m.
behaviorTimer_m - the amount of time since the last time the behavior was updated to the next interval.

Update() - runs every frame, allowing the enemy to cycle it's behavior in a loop based on BEHAVIOURINTERVAL and behaviorTimer_m using
behaviourIterator_m.

Shoot() - Defines a virtual function that daughter classes may inherit from defining there own unique attacking strategies.
