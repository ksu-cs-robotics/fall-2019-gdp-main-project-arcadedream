Game Programming and Game Testing team


Members:


Objectives:


- Gameplay Programmers: create scripts for performing actions in the game

- Tester: test the game, report all bugs and problems to the other teams. They are responsible for reporting any and all bugs/problems and document them, as even the ones that donâ€™t go unfixed should still be documented for the future. Finding bugs in the demo that were not documented but are fairly common will be a bad point against the team

- Color in chart: blue
