Story:

This game takes place in a small town where a new arcade just opened up. As one of select lucky winners, you get to test out games at this arcade before it opens up. The owner seems nice enough, but you’re more focused on the games at this point. Maybe just look over your shoulder every once in a while…


Characters: 

Player characters as custom avatars created at the start of the game. They are young adult humanoids living in the current year. Their outfits and costumes can be customized. 


Level/environment design: 

There are two aspects to this: the arcade itself, and each arcade game. The arcade itself will house all the arcade games and some of the NPCs that the players will interact with. This can be expanded each time a game is added to accomodate for it. Various areas outside the arcade can be added if the story is expanded upon in that manner.


Gameplay:

Mainly this game will revolve around the player walking around an arcade using a created avatar (customizable) and playing games at the arcade. The player walks up to an arcade game and either plays it single player or opts in for multiplayer and waits for others to walk up and join them. The game transitions to whatever game the player selects and runs a new session for multiplayer if needed. Succeeding at the games will earn you rewards such as cosmetic things for your avatar or maybe something to expand on the overarching story with the arcade itself. 
Examples:

Lobby from Dragon Ball Fighterz

Lobby from Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2


Art:

The art style can be simple and cartoony. Nothing too complex. Right now it is up to the art team.

Sound and Music:

For the arcade, the sound will be whimisical and cartoony. Simple and light sound effects for interacting with things in the arcade. This will be up to the sound team. 

Sound effects and music will be different for each arcade game.

User Interface, Game Controls:

The heads up display in the arcade will have some data about the player, such as their name and arcade high score, and what lobby they are in. It will also show a chat log for the messages people have sent in the lobby and an interface to send messages yourself. The controls will involve basic movement and a button to interact with arcade machines and another to bring up the chat options. 

The UI will differ for each arcade game, and so will the controls.
